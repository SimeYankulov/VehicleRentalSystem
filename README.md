A Console application, vehicle rental system, using .NET C# for an internship
First off i did the abstract super class for vehicle and made Car,Motorcycle,CargoVan extend the class
Then i added the properties and methods for managing them.
Next I created the User and its properties
After that i created Rental class and created a bunch of exmple data to work with.
While creating the print method i added methods in the vehicle subclasses to access data.
While creating the print method i've created the logic from the task, while trying to do clean readable code.
At the end i tested it with the example data plus i changed a few things to see if it works with different data.
